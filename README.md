# Radio Frequency Fingerprinting Data Acquisition System Design
    https://github.com/HuseyinPARMAKSIZ/GNU-Radio-Signal-capture-block-diagram
It has been implemented in the open source DragonOS operating system installed on the RPi 4 device. HackRF One was used as software defined radio and GNU Radio was used as signal capture tool.
# Feature Set Creation for Radio Frequency Fingerprinting Identification 
Statistical methods were applied to EMD, instantaneous phase/frequency/amplitude values. (kurtosis, skewness, variance, standard deviation etc.)
# Feature Reduction/Selection with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) / Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR)
Among the obtained features, the 8 most effective ones were selected by MRMR. Feature reduction independent of MRMR was performed with PCA.
Feel free to discuss with and contact me! (All codes are in the testing phase yet!!!)
